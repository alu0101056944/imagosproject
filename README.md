# Description

Domain Specific Languages are a good way to make more explicit the process of bone age estimation. This program can be used to setup bone measurements that are compared to an atlas's measurements to obtain an age estimation. The main objective is to offer an open system as opposed to black box alternatives for the Greulich Pyle, Tanner-Whitehouse methods for bone age estimation.
