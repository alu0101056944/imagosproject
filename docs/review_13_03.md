# Review

 - Question to make: How are different same-type bones named? carpal1, carpal2, ... **Because currently it is assumed that a bone has a unique name**.

 - Idea: Add cli command to get information about current atlas to not have to visualize it's files.

 - Maybe An atlas age and gender must be assigned always because right now when loading an atlas there is a default age and genre defined. (age 15, male)
